    "You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.",
    "At the end of the day, whether or not those people are comfortable with how you're living your life doesn't matter. What matters is whether you're comfortable with it.",

    "All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination.",
    "If you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely."
